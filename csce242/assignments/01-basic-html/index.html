        <h1>How Music Unites Us</h1>
        <p>Afro Beat is a West African music genre that is a child to funk, jazz, and other soul influences.
            <br>Dreamville is a concert that was created by an artist named J. Cole. For my seventeenth birthday<br>
            I went to the concert for the first time and thats when I first heard Afro Beat live. That was the 
            <br>first time where I saw people of all different type of ethnicities and backgrounds dancing together.<br>
        </p>
        <p>
            Coming from a culture where it is prodominatly African American I did not see much of
            <br>this in my childhood. It was very exciting to see people step out of the box musically which<br>
            I felt, lead to unification. While I was at the concert, people with different backgrounds would spark 
            <br>up a conversation with me and would share stories about how they were introduced to Afro Beat or<br>
            how they felt when they first heard it. In conclusion, Afro Beat is a genre of music that can bring
            <br>people together and connect us all in a unique way.<br>
