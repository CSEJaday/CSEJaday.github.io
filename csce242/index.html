                    <p>This assignment gave us the opportunity to apply basic
                        html. We had to implement a page and include headers, paragraphs,
                        and images. We also had to implement a bulleted list, a table, and two
                        external links.

                    <p>This assignment gave us the opportunity to apply basic css
                        to our webpage. We had to implement cool colors that followed
                        a certain color scheme. We also had to pick a background image
                        and adjust the shadow so the picture could appear through the secondary background.

                    <p>In this assignment we used flex boxing to create different layouts across our screens.
                        We also used media query to show how it should look on a smaller screen.
                        We included the meadia query in the css file along with our other pieces of css.

                    <p>In this assignment we were able to put our flex boxing and positioning skills to the test.
                        We had to recreate the USC School of Medicine Website. We were also being challenged on if we
                        were to be given any page can we recreate it. Including css was also a big part of this assignment
                        which ultimately brings the website together.

                    <p>This will guide you to my project proposal page.
                        My idea that I came up with for my personal website
                        is a site where you will be able to order tents for your event.
                        The great thing is you don't have to come and put them up, all you 
                        have to do is show up to your event!

                        I chose to do a tent event website and here you can see
