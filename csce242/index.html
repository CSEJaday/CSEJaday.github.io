                    <p>This assignment gave us the opportunity to apply basic
                        html. We had to implement a page and include headers, paragraphs,
                        and images. We also had to implement a bulleted list, a table, and two
                        external links.

                    <p>This assignment gave us the opportunity to apply basic css
                        to our webpage. We had to implement cool colors that followed
                        a certain color scheme. We also had to pick a background image
                        and adjust the shadow so the picture could appear through the secondary background.

                    <p>In this assignment we used flex boxing to create different layouts across our screens.
                        We also used media query to show how it should look on a smaller screen.
                        We included the meadia query in the css file along with our other pieces of css.

                    <p>In this assignment we were able to put our flex boxing and positioning skills to the test.
                        We had to recreate the USC School of Medicine Website. We were also being challenged on if we
                        were to be given any page can we recreate it. Including css was also a big part of this assignment
                        which ultimately brings the website together.

                    <p>
                        In this assignment we used javascript to make a shape appear when the box was clicked.
                        We also had the opportunity have the date selection box appear and once the user selects a date
                        a message appeared in the box letting them know what date was selected. Lastly, we had to use 
                        javascript and css to make a colorful border appear when the image is clicked.

                    <p>This will guide you to my project proposal page.
                        My idea that I came up with for my personal website
                        is a site where you will be able to order tents for your event.
                        The great thing is you don't have to come and put them up, all you 
                        have to do is show up to your event!

                        This is a link to my wireframe for my website.
                        I chose to do a tent event website and here you can see
                        the cool design I came up with!

                        This is my complete wireframe for my website. This wireframe is more polished than the last.
                        I also included so better designs, design layouts, and a better naviagtion bar!
